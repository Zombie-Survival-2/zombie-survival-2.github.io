				<p><strong>Please note that none of the information on this page represents Zombie Survival 2's actual gameplay, for this MOTD is still a work in progress.</strong></p>
				<p>In Zombie Survival 2, there are only six survivors each round, and their task can vary between rounds. There can only be one survivor per class, so it is important to communicate with the team in order to maximise the chance of victory.</p>
				<p>Below is the list of each survivor class and how they can be most effective in ZS2:</p>
				<table class="table">
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/1/13/Icon_scout.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Scout</h3>
								<p>While the Scout has a high run speed, the outbreak has taken a toll on his strength. He can no longer double jump, and objectives are simply too heavy for him to carry out. He is forced to rely on the other members of his team to complete such objectives for him. He even becomes slower as his team's numbers decrease.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c1/Icon_soldier.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Soldier</h3>
								<p>As a fighter for freedom, the Soldier retains many of his abilities hailed from America. He can easily use his rocket launcher to fend off the swarm and to propel himself away, but care should be taken as the special ammunition required has led to his push force being reduced.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/1/13/Icon_pyro.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Pyro</h3>
								<p>The Pyro has got it pretty tough. The zombie horde has turned out to be quite resistant to the pushing power of the airblast, but thankfully they are still quite flammable.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/c/c0/Icon_demoman.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Demoman</h3>
								<p>The Demoman won't be stopped by his constant intoxication from letting the zombies get to him. He has enough power in his arsenal to rival the damage output and mobility of the Soldier.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/8/8e/Icon_heavy.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Heavy</h3>
								<p>Unfortunately for the Heavy, outrunning the contagion is not an option. He must rely on his high-damage minigun as the primary means of staying alive. Even his lunch has spoiled in the rotten air.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/bc/Icon_engineer.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Engineer</h3>
								<p>Luckily for the rest of the team, the Engineer has managed to modify his buildings to better suit the dangerous environment. His Sentries may require more parts to build, but he can easily construct wide Dispensers to block doorways and teleport his team to safety.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/f/f5/Icon_medic.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Medic</h3>
								<p>Something about the air has made the Medic's tools of the trade malfunction to a degree. It doesn't seem possible for him to heal anyone except himself, not unless he is able to accumulate an ÃœberCharge, which can only quickly restore a fellow teammate to full health.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/a/ac/Icon_sniper.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Sniper</h3>
								<p>The zombies are simply too twitchy for the Sniper to reliably take down. This impending crisis has forced him to rely on his secondary items and melee in close combat, but there's no harm in going for his signature headshots anyway.</p>
							</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td class="picture"><img src="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/9/9b/Icon_spy.jpg"></td>
							<td>
								<h3>Spy</h3>
								<p>Being a master of disguise, the Spy is able to sneak behind the zombies and surprise them with a well placed stab in the back. He had just better hope that they don't smell him on his way back to the team.</p>
							</td>
