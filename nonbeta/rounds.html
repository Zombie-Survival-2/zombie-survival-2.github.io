				<p><strong>Please note that none of the information on this page represents Zombie Survival 2's actual gameplay, for this MOTD is still a work in progress.</strong></p>
				<p>Before each round starts, a quick poll takes place so that all players can collectively choose what type of gameplay they would like to participate in next. There are currently five round types in Zombie Survival 2, which are listed below:</p>
				<h2>Attack</h2>
				<p>During Attack rounds, the survivors are required to complete the objective of the map to win. On Attack/Defend, Payload and similar maps, the survivors will be switched to the BLU team in order to achieve their goal. In other cases such as Capture the Flag and Control Points, the survivors will remain on the RED team.</p>
				<h2>Defend</h2>
				<p>Defend rounds are the same as Attack, but with the roles reversed. It is far more common for survivors to be on the RED team during this time.</p>
				<h2>Survival</h2>
				<p>Survival is the closest that ZS2 gets to what made the original ZS so long-lasting. In these rounds, the survivors must keep themselves alive for a set amount of time.</p>
				<h2>Waves</h2>
				<p>Waves behaves very similarly to Survival, but there are a set amount of zombies that must be killed within the time limit. No more zombies spawn than is indicated.</p>
				<h2>Scavenge</h2>
				<p>The Scavenge round type is mostly inspired by that in Left 4 Dead 2. The survivors are tasked with collecting a number of specific items scattered around the map in randomised locations, and returning them to a safe zone. This must be done within the time limit for the survivors to win.</p>
